# ADR-2: Curriculum Versioning Strategy

> **Scope**: Document decision clusters, not individual technology choices. Group related decisions that work together (e.g., "Frontend Stack" not separate ADRs for framework, styling, deployment).

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2025-12-04
- **Feature:** robotics-curriculum
- **Context:** The curriculum content needs a versioning strategy to manage updates across different cohorts or releases, as the field of AI and robotics is rapidly evolving.

<!-- Significance checklist (ALL must be true to justify this ADR)
     1) Impact: Long-term consequence for architecture/platform/security?
     2) Alternatives: Multiple viable options considered with tradeoffs?
     3) Scope: Cross-cutting concern (not an isolated detail)?
     If any are false, prefer capturing as a PHR note instead of an ADR. -->

To be determined.

## Consequences

### Positive

To be determined.

### Negative

To be determined.

## Alternatives Considered

- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Date-based versioning (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Cohort-based naming (e.g., "Fall 2025 Release")
