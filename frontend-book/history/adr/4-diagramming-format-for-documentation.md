# ADR-4: Diagramming Format for Documentation

> **Scope**: Document decision clusters, not individual technology choices. Group related decisions that work together (e.g., "Frontend Stack" not separate ADRs for framework, styling, deployment).

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2025-12-04
- **Feature:** robotics-curriculum
- **Context:** The curriculum documentation will include diagrams to explain complex concepts. A consistent format is needed, with options like Mermaid and SVG.

<!-- Significance checklist (ALL must be true to justify this ADR)
     1) Impact: Long-term consequence for architecture/platform/security?
     2) Alternatives: Multiple viable options considered with tradeoffs?
     3) Scope: Cross-cutting concern (not an isolated detail)?
     If any are false, prefer capturing as a PHR note instead of an ADR. -->
